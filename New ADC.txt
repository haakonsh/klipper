New AVR ADC API that supports differential inputs


Problem:
The default thermistor sampling circuit in the Einsy Rambo(Prusa MK3*) control board is poorly designed, and a possible improvement utilizing a differential input ADC channel cannot be implemented using the current ADC API.

Current ADC API defines 16 single-ended and no differential input channels. Where Atmega2560(Einsy Rambo) supports 18 single-ended and 22 differential input channels[Table 26-4 Input Channel Selections in Atmega2560 datasheet]. 

Current ADC API defines 16 ADC channels where each channel is referenced via the following struct:

struct gpio_adc {
    uint8_t chan;
};

and where each channel is mapped to a physical pin by the index of the following struct:

static const uint8_t adc_pins[] PROGMEM = {
...
    GPIO('F', 0), GPIO('F', 1), GPIO('F', 2), GPIO('F', 3),
    GPIO('F', 4), GPIO('F', 5), GPIO('F', 6), GPIO('F', 7),
    GPIO('K', 0), GPIO('K', 1), GPIO('K', 2), GPIO('K', 3),
    GPIO('K', 4), GPIO('K', 5), GPIO('K', 6), GPIO('K', 7),
...
};

The Atmega2560 registers ADMUX and ADCSRB controls the ADC input selection through the MUX0:5 bits, where ADMUX contains the MUX0:4 bits and ADCSRB contain the MUX5 bit. MUX0:2 represent analog input pin 0-7 and MUX5 represents whether the analog input pins of port F or K is used.

uint32_t
gpio_adc_sample(struct gpio_adc g)
{
...
    // Set the channel to sample
#if defined(ADCSRB) && defined(MUX5)
    // The MUX5 bit of ADCSRB selects whether we're reading from
    // channels 0 to 7 (MUX5 low) or 8 to 15 (MUX5 high).
    ADCSRB = ((g.chan >> 3) & 0x01) << MUX5;
#endif
    ADMUX = ADMUX_DEFAULT | (g.chan & 0x07);
...
}

In gpio_adc_sample() hardcodes whether port K or F is used based on a configuration flag. This drops the amount of ADC channels down to 8.

I need an ADC API that can represent all of the given AVR's ADC channels rather than an arbitrary sub-set.

Solution:
An ADC channel is mapped directly to the AVR's MUX bits:

struct gpio_adc {
    uint8_t adcsra;
    uint8_t adcsrb;
    uint8_t admux;
    uint8_t didr0;
    uint8_t didr2;
};

    Check out PrinterBoardAliases and how it parses pin aliases.
        The pin/admux parameter in config_analog_in("oid=%c admux=%u", ...) needs to be parsed as %u on MCU side,
        and %s on python host side. Somehow the python scripts turns a string into a uint8_t.

TODO: Done!
    Override printer.config:205 with e_sensor_pin currently defined at printer_data/config/RatOS/boards/prusa-einsy/config.cfg:15. 
    For some reason I can't override pin aliases when I override the pin alias e_sensor_pin in printer.cfg,
    I get a type error from the host.
        [extruder]
        sensor_pin: 9
        sensor_type: ATC Semitec 104GT-2

        [heater_bed]
        sensor_type: EPCOS 100K B57560G104F
        sensor_pin: 2

TODO:
    Verify ADC values. For some reason the bed thermistor report negative ADC codes, and they are out of range of a single-channel ADC.

TODO:
    Find the definitions of ADC min and max values given by the MCU command query_analog_in of adccmds.c:100
        It seems to be given by the constant ADC_MAX decleared in adc.c, multiplied by the oversample factor,
        then multiplied by a the floats passed into setup_minmax(minval, maxval, ...) (mcu.py:505).

        I don't know who passes these arguments yet.


TODO: 
    The MCU's ADC min/max values are defined universally for all channels. This is a problem when ADC channels have a different ranges.
    Typical use-case is when both single-ended and differential channels are in use. I suggest to use unique min/max definitions
    for each enabled channel.
